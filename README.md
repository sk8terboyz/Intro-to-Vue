# Intro-to-Vue

Shane Kennedy

Programming Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, VueJS

This was a project I did when I first learned Vue. It is obviously not the best shopping website or anything, but it gave me a good understanding of the basic principles of how to use Vue.

*About this app*
This project was a follow-up on a tutorial where I learned Vue. I forget what the tutorial was and where I got it specifically, but my work acquired use of it awhile ago. I used the tutorial video to get a good understanding of Vue and then built upon it a little more for my own benefits. There isn't a whole lot special about this project, but it was also when I started learning CSS, so some variations may be thrown into it.
